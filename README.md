# This is just a template for vite with tailwindcss configured.

# Getting started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Enjoy the your tailwind ready project!

# More about this

This project is literally a blank project created with `yarn create @vitejs/app my-app --template vanilla` with config files ripped straight out of [the tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). 

I made this because I didn't find the template I wanted and it didn't look like a lot of work, I hope that this thing saves you one or two minutes!
